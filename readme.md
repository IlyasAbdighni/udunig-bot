Deep learning has emerged as a new area of machine learning research. It tries to mimic the human brain, which is capable of processing and learning from the complex input data and solving different kinds of complicated tasks well. It has been successfully applied to several fields such as images, sounds, text and motion. The techniques developed from deep learning research have already been impacting the research of natural language process. This paper reviews the recent research on deep learning, its applications and recent development in natural language processing.
